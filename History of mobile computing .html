<h1><u>History of mobile computing</u></h1>
<h3>Early mainframe-centric computing was sometimes provisioned with remote access over modem-based, or dial-up, landline connections, typically at 300 to 1,200 bits per second. Subscriber devices, in this case, were terminals only, usually Teletypes or their CRT-based equivalents. <br></br>Mobile terminals appeared during this era, and although they were much larger, heavier and more expensive than today's mobile computers, and network speeds remained slow, mobile -- at the time, nomadic-only -- computing quickly gained popularity. The development of initial mobile computers in the late 1970s centered on sewing machine-size PCs -- e.g., the Osborne 1 and the Compaq Portable -- based on early operating systems, such as CP/M and MS-DOS. Featuring floppy disks, small monochrome CRT displays and, when available, plug-in (RJ-11) modems of up to 2,400 bps, these nomadic devices still required AC power. Similarly, early laptop computers -- most notably the first, the GRiD Systems Compass Computer 1101 -- also required AC power and were large, heavy and expensive. Early laptops quickly gained popularity, especially with the refinement to the smaller notebook form factor and the inclusion of add-on and eventually internal Wi-Fi links, reliable battery power, contemporary operating systems -- Microsoft Windows, MacOS and Linux -- improved displays and reduced prices. <br></br>Modern smartphones evolved from personal digital assistants (PDAs), which first appeared in the early 1990s, an outgrowth of personal organizer devices designed to store and retrieve information needed for personal productivity, such as calendars and phone directories. Taking advantage of improvements in the hardware components noted above, the development of appropriate operating systems culminated in today's Android and iOSoperating systems, and the addition of cellular voice, data and Wi-Fi led to the smartphones available today. <br></br> BlackBerry introduced the first smartphone, and the launch of the Apple iPhone in 2007 opened the floodgates of end-user demand. The tablet PC, featuring touch- and pen-based interfaces, can trace its roots to the early 1980s, and it was initially popular in industrial and commercial applications. <br></br> Apple's initialiPad (2010) introduced many consumers to this form factor, and both iOS and Android models remain popular today. Cotemporary tablets are essentially smartphones in large form factors, most importantly offering larger displays. <br></br> Many tablet models do not include integral cellular communications, but do connect to Wi-Fi. The mobile computing architecture of today is increasingly cloud-centric, with web- and cloud-based access essential in many applications. <br></br> Key cloud-based services include software distribution, device management, data storage and sharing, and access to shared applications.</h3>

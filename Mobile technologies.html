<h1><u>Mobile technologies </u></h1>
<h3>Most vendors of microprocessor integrated circuits offer mobile versions of their products, featuring lower power consumption, smaller physical size and, consequentially, often lower performance than their desktop counterparts. Such is not an issue for most mobile applications, and the broad range -- including physical size and price -- of mobile devices available today can address most application demands Wireless <br></br>Communications are well-established, and today's Wi-Fi and 4G networks can offer throughput adequate for essentially every application. With the recent reintroduction of unlimited cellular data service plans, most users find their monthly data expense bounded and manageable, with good availability, reliability and throughputColor graphics displays are universal on mobile computing devices today, with smartphones, tablets and some notebooks featuring touch as their primary human-computer interaction model. <br></br> As displays are a major consumer of battery power, much product engineering today is devoted to improving the performance of this vital element, including more efficient backlighting for LCD screens and OLED displays. <br></br> Mobile data storage is rapidly advancing to all-solid-state designs based on flash memory technology. <br></br>Costs of flash continue to decline, along with improvements in access speeds and physical storage density. <br></br>Today, cloud-based storage is used primarily for backup, bulk storage and file sharing, but may take on a role as primary storage as wireless services become more pervasive, reliable, fast and cost-effective. <br></br>Some local storage will likely always be desirable, but cloud-based storage will likely result in lower device cost, longer battery life and lower device weight</h3>
